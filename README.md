# IoTide
Marine life detection project
With growing concern over marine pollution 
and habitat degradation, there is an urgent need for real-time, 
scalable, and cost-effective underwater monitoring solutions. 
This research presentsâ€¯IoTide, an intelligent IoT-based system 
designed to capture, process, and classify underwater images 
for the detection of aquatic life and debris. The system 
employs an ESP32-CAM module for continuous video 
capture, with image frames processed using a pre-trained 
PyTorch model based on the YOLOv8 architecture. To 
address underwater visibility challenges, improving detection 
in murky conditions. Data is currently transmitted via USB to 
a ground unit for processing, with planned scalability toward 
underwater acoustic transmission and cloud-based 
integration. IoTide is not only capable of recognizing multiple 
species and debris types in real time but also offers 
opportunities for integration into environmental monitoring 
frameworks. The proposed solution demonstrates promising 
accuracy and affordability, making it suitable for deployment 
in research, conservation, aquaculture, and pollution 
assessment.
